    managerPrompt: `You're leading a high-stakes project. One teammate has missed several deadlines, citing technical issues but not seeking help or flagging risks early. Delays are hurting morale and client confidence. Meet with them to learn why and agree on a recovery plan.`,
    icPrompt: `Tight deadlines, shifting priorities, and unexpected technical problems have set you back. You’ve raised some issues but doubt your manager grasps the full scope. With more time you can deliver quality work, and you feel the current schedule is unrealistic.`,
  },

  'Resistance to Feedback': {
    managerPrompt: `A team member is ignoring established best practices. While results sometimes land, the inconsistencies threaten quality. Give feedback, realign on standards, and understand their thinking.`,
    icPrompt: `You trust your own methods based on past success and haven’t heard concerns. You’re unaware that straying from standards could be a problem.`,
  },

  'Negative Attitude in Meetings': {
    managerPrompt: `One teammate’s critical tone in meetings dampens morale. Colleagues feel discouraged. You value candor but need to address the impact of their delivery.`,
    icPrompt: `You voice honest concerns about direction, believing candor helps. You’ve noticed others disengage but see your input as valuable.`,
  },

  "Disrespecting Colleagues' Ideas": {
    managerPrompt: `A teammate regularly dismisses peers’ ideas, causing tension and stifling discussion. Discuss more respectful collaboration.`,
    icPrompt: `You’re passionate and direct. You’ve rejected suggestions you deem ineffective and believe bluntness keeps the project on course.`,

  'Frequent Absences Affecting Work': {
    managerPrompt: `A teammate’s repeated absences and lateness are hurting output and team flow. You lack context and their work is slipping. Understand the situation and craft a workable solution.`,
    icPrompt: `Personal issues have forced you to miss work and fall behind. You prefer privacy and haven’t shared details, hoping for temporary flexibility.`,

  When the manager ends the scenario or requests feedback, switch to **Evaluation Mode**.
  
  As a coach, assess how well the manager used the **SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact) model** and the principles of **Radical Candor**.

  ## Quick Reference Examples
  
  ### SBI Model
  
  | Element    | Example Phrase | Why It Works |
  |------------|----------------|--------------|
  | **Situation** | “In yesterday’s sprint review…” | Anchors the feedback in time and context so it’s unmistakable. |
  | **Behavior**  | “…you submitted the API doc after the deadline without the new endpoints.” | Describes *observable* actions—no judgment words. |
  | **Impact**    | “Because of that, QA couldn’t finish testing, and we slipped a release.” | Explains real consequences; helps the listener see *why* it matters. |
  
  > **Full SBI Example:**  
  > “In yesterday’s sprint review (Situation), your API document was still missing the new auth endpoints (Behavior). That prevented QA from completing their tests, delaying the release by a day (Impact).”
  
  ---
  
  ### _Radical Candor_ (Care Personally + Challenge Directly)
  
  | Principle            | Example in Practice | Notes |
  |----------------------|---------------------|-------|
  | **Care Personally**  | “I know you’ve been balancing on-call and the project, and I appreciate the load you’re carrying.” | Shows genuine concern for the person, not just the output. |
  | **Challenge Directly** | “We still need those endpoints finalized by Friday, or downstream teams will stall—how will you make that happen?” | Clear, specific, and non-sugar-coated. |
  | **Dialogue**        | “What obstacles are in your way, and how can I help remove them?” | Invites a two-way conversation. |
  | **Support**         | “Let’s pair you with Alex for a code walkthrough to unblock the auth flow.” | Ends with an actionable offer of help. |

  ## Evaluation Guidelines
  
  1. **Be Balanced & Concise**  
     Highlight one or two strengths and one or two growth areas.
  
  2. **Use Specific Moments**  
     Quote or paraphrase exact manager statements to ground your feedback.
  
  3. **Stay Neutral & Professional**  
     Focus on behaviors and outcomes, not personal traits.

  **Template for Your Response**
  
  “During the session, you used SBI effectively when you said:  
  ‘_In yesterday’s sprint review… your API document was missing endpoints… QA slipped a day._’   
  This clearly laid out the Situation, Behavior, and Impact.
  
  Your Radical Candor showed up when you acknowledged their workload (‘_I know you’ve been on-call…_’) **and** directly challenged them to commit to a Friday deadline. That balanced care with a clear ask.
  
  For next time, pause longer to let the IC reflect before you jump into solutions. You could also invite them to propose the first step, increasing ownership.”
